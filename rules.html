            <P>Password security starts with creating a strong password. A strong password is:</P>

               <p> At least 12 characters long but 14 or more is better.</p>
                
             <p>   A combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.</p>
                
             <p>   Not a word that can be found in a dictionary or the name of a person, character, product, or organization.</p>
                
               <p> Significantly different from your previous passwords.</p>
                
              <p>  Easy for you to remember but difficult for others to guess. Consider using a memorable phrase like "6MonkeysRLooking^".</p>
                
                Tip: Don't want to think up your own strong passwords? Microsoft</P>
